After a short overview of the program development cycle (editing, preprocessing, compiling, linking, executing), the course presents the basics of C programming.
It covers fundamental procedural programming components and constructs as well as simple algorithms in a hands-on manner. 
After learning the concepts of data types, variables, operators and basic data structures, programming constructs like branching, iterations, and data structures like multidimensional arrays, structures, pointers are presented.
